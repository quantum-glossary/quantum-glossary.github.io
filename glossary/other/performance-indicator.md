## Examples

In quantum computing the most commonly used indicators are:
-  **Fidelity**<a href="#fidelity"></a>: A measure of closeness of two quantum states. Used to compare noiseless simulation to noisy physical execution. **Gate Fidelity** is the fidelity induced by a single quantum gate.
- **Duration**: Overall execution time of a quantum operation, usually related to the coherence time.
- **Gate-Depth**: The maximum number of (multi-qudit) gates on a qudit. Most commonly as T-Gate-Depth, which only counts a specific set of gates.
- **Noise Resilience**: A measure of how well a circuit performs on varying levels of noise. No concrete metric exists yet.
